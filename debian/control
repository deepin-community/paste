 Python Paste brings consistency to Python web development and web application
 installation, providing tools for both developers and system administrators.

 Paste for Administrators:
  * Easily install, run, and configure multiple Paste-enabled web
    applications at once, and integrate them into your website how
    you want (SCGI, FCGI, AJP, WSGI)
  * Manage and install web applications system-wide for easy maintenance
 .
 Paste for Web Developers:
  * Increase your web application's audience
  * Provide starter templates and custom commands for using your web framework
  * Keep your development and deployment straightened out, and your automated
    testing streamlined
  * Attention payed to the full development cycle -- starting projects,
    converting old projects, updating and deploying projects -- using a set of
    complementary packages and tools
 .
 This package provides the Sphinx generated documentation for Paste.
